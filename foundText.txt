n recent years, bankers have i || sometimes been characterized t_1 as parasites, dealing in wealth created by the labour of others. Francois Quesnay (p.45), a French farm worker's son and one of the great minds of the 18th century, might recognize this description. Quesnay argued that wealth lies not in gold and silver, but springs from production — the output of the farmer or manufacturer. He argued that agriculture is so valuable because it works with nature — which multiplies the farmer's effort and resources — to produce a net surplus. Manufacturing, on the other

In 1935 Tauschek was also granted a US patent on his method (U.S. Patent 2,026,329). Tauschek's machine was a mechanical device that used templates and a photodetector.

Shepard; a cryptanalyst at the Armed Forces Security Agency in the United States, addressed the problem of converting printed messages into machine language for computer processing and built a machine to do this, reported in the Washington Daily News on 27 April 1951 and in the New York Times on 26 December 1953 ‘after his U.S. Patent 2,663,758 was issued. Shepard then founded Intelligent Machines Research Corporation (IMR), which went on to deliver the world's first several OCR systems used in commercial operation. The first commercial system was installed at the Reader's Digest in 1955. The second system was sold to the Standard Oil Company for reading credit card imprints for billing purposes. Other systems sold by IMR during the late 1950s included a bill stub reader to the Ohio Bell Telephone Company and a page scanner to the United States Air Force for reading and transmitting by teletype typewritten messages. IBM and others. were later licensed on Shepard's OCR patents. 
Header In about 1965 Reader's Digest and RCA collaborated to build an OCR Document reader designed to digitise the serial numbers on Reader's Digest coupons returned from advertisements. The font used on the documents were printed by an RCA Drum printer using the OCR-A font. The reader was connected directly to an RCA 301 computer (one of the first solid state computers). This reader was followed by a specialised document reader installed at TWA where the reader processed Airline Ticket stock. The readers processed document at a rate of 1,500 documents per minute, and checked each document, rejecting those it was not able to process correctly. The product became part of the RCA product line as a reader designed to process "Turn around Documents" such as those Utility and insurance bills returned with payments.

In 1965 it began planning an entire banking system, the National Giro, using OCR technology, a process that revolutionized bill payment systems in the UK. Canada Post has been using OCR systems since 1971[citation needed]. OCR systems read the name and address of the addressee at the first mechanised sorting center, and print a routing bar code on the envelope based on the postal code. To avoid confusion with the human- readable address field which can be located anywhere on the letter, special ink (orange in visible light) is used that is clearly visible under ultraviolet light. Envelopes may then be processed with equipment based on simple barcode readers.
